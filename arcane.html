        <h1>Riot sucks, Arcane good />
<p> Those of us who have played League of Legends as sweaty teenagers are very aware that Riot games has had its fair share of controversy over the years. Arcane however, animated by french studio Fortiche (who also animated that incredible K/DA video), is pretty damn good.</p>

<h2>Reasons Arcane is damn good</h2>
<p>I didn't expect much from this show but I binged the whole thing in one night so I was proven wrong. Here's why I think its good</p>
<ul> 
    <li> The animation is stunning </li>
    <li> The voice acting for the characters is amazing</li>
    <li> Being able to see the backstories for some of the best League characters is great</li>
    <li> Looking into all the theories as to why some of the "new" characters might actually be pre existing champions</li>
</ul>

<p> And here are my favourite characters in no particular order </p>
<ol>
    <li> Jinx / Powder </li>
    <li> Viktor </li>
    <li> VI </li>
    <li> Kindred's cool as hell cameo </li>
</ol>
